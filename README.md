# Efficacy Of Canvas

## Objective:
Canvas is one of the fastest-growing learning management platforms. 
This allows schools to build a digital, interactive and simplified 
learning environment to enhance learning. 

In this report, the effectiveness of canvas in academic learning is 
tested by developing a linear regression model which analyzes the 
relationship between the time spent by the students on the Canvas 
and their Average score in the course.

## Assumptions:
There are certain assumptions involved with data collection and variables.
- All students are studying independently and individually.
- The amount of time they spent on canvas is completely utilized in studying and learning.
- Sample Students represent the entire population.
- The Engineering course represents the combination of all types of learning modes, for example, reading, critical thinking, Numerical, recitation, writing, etc.
- The students belong to all types of backgrounds and are chosen randomly.

## Conclusion:
The analysis shows that we __cannot rule out the plausible 
No effectiveness__ of the Canvas at OSU. 

The most important assumption is that the student has utilized the 
time on canvas in learning. 
Primary analysis suggest that __Canvas is a useful and convenient tool 
for managing but not for learning.__ 

Extensive future work can be done to have more strong inference on the effectiveness of Canvas.
